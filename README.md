# PSGaming
This is a README file about my opinions on video games. I have seperate video games from multiple genres here, giving my opinions on each game. I'll also be giving out hints and tips to said games for anyone that would like to know about something they didn't know or understand. :) Most of these games are up to date new released or still trending, but I will still provide a year-to-date release around the game. 

I have put these features in my project: 
    CSS - Hamburger Menu. 

Open "index.html" for opening sequence for the website.
