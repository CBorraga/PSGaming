    <h2 class="gamesow">Overwatch</h2>
    <h3 class="gamesv5">A little bit about Overwatch:</h3>
    <p class="gamesv5">Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter 
        developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. Described as a "hero 
        shooter", Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player 
        selecting from a roster of over 30 characters, known as "heroes", each with
         a unique style of play that is divided into three general roles that fit 
         their purpose. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control 
         points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. 
         Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character 
         skins and victory poses, as they play the game. The game was initially launched 
         with only casual play, but a competitive ranked mode, various 'arcade' game modes,
          and a player-customizable server browser were added after release. Additionally,
           Blizzard has added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, all free 
           of charge, with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes 
           to earn cosmetic items.</p>

    <h4 class="gamesv3">My review:</h4>
    <p class="gamesv5">I really fell in love with the concept of how easy this game was to play for everyone.
         If you're a fan of Dota 2, or League of Legends but want a more 'involved' experience, you can come
        here. This game doesn't have a pay to win option, just pay for cosmetics. If you like playing for fun
         and making content for Youtube or similiar, you have the Quick Play option. You can play any game
         mode to level up and unlock loot boxes you can use to get 4 items for any character! Spray some walls,
          say some cool/cheesy voice lines, do a cool emote, or even have some amazing looking skins!<br></p>
    <p class="gamesv5">If you like doing anything competitive, like Dota 2 or League of Legends, you can play
        their competitive mode! You can still level up, and earn more experience playing competitive. You get
        SR which means Skill Rating. Skill Rating is sorted like so:<br>
        <img src="images/Competitive_Bronze_Icon.png" width="30" height="30">1-1499 = Silver<br>
        <img src="images/Competitive_Gold_Icon.png" width="30" height="30">2000-2499 = Gold<br>
        <img src="images/Competitive_Platinum_Icon.png" width="30" height="30">2500-2999 = Platinum<br>
        <img src="images/Competitive_Diamond_Icon.png" width="30" height="30">3000-3499 = Diamond<br>
        <img src="images/Competitive_Master_Icon.png" width="30" height="30">3500-3999 = Master<br>
        <img src="images/Competitive_Grandmaster_Icon.png" width="30" height="30">4000-5000 = Grandmaster<br>
    </p>
    <p class="gamesv5">When you get into Grandmaster, you have a chance to go Top 500. This means you are
         top 500 in your region.<br></p>
    <p class="gamesv5">Below are some helpful beginner tips!</p>

    <h5 class="owh5">1. Be flexible and learn at least one hero from each class</h5>
    <p class="gamesv5">Until you've reached the upper echelons of Overwatch's competitive circuit,
         it's best to prioritize balance when building your team's hero composition. The in-game 
         prompts do a decent job of nudging you in the right direction, providing a clear indication
          of when your team could benefit from including a Support hero or an extra tank. But, as is
           the case in most multiplayer games, you'll inevitably get matched with players who insist
            on playing their favorite hero, with no consideration for what the team actually needs.
             You, on the other hand, are substantially less selfish, so you should endeavor to master
              at least one hero from the Damage, Tank, and Support classes, and flex between roles
               depending on what your team needs most. If you're unsure which playstyle might suit you,
                look to Soldier 76, Reinhardt, and Lucio - they're powerful and beginner-friendly
                 heroes in their respective roles.</p>

    <h6 class="owh5">2. Stay focused on the win condition</h6>
    <p class="gamesv5">Team Fortress 2 veterans will surely remember the Medic's classic line,
         "Get on the point, dummkopf!" Translation: If you're chasing kills instead of focusing 
         on the objective, you're not playing properly. Eliminations will only go so far in Overwatch,
          because the win conditions are always objective-based, whether you're capturing a point or 
          pushing a payload. It's most important to remember this when your team wipes out the opposition
           and starts gaining momentum - that's when it's easiest to get cocky and overextend way too far
            into enemy territory, rather than using the downtime to lock down the objective. Ideally, 
            you should always be standing on a point, escorting a payload, or focusing on the 
            next opportunity to do so.</p>

    <h6 class="owh5">3. Don't fight alone</h6>
    <p class="gamesv5">This is a tragic mistake that plagues the majority of multiplayer
         shooters: amidst the chaos of battle, your stubborn teammates blindly charge the
          enemy one by one, and predictably get picked off in quick succession by the grouped-up
           opposing force. It sounds obvious, but always remind yourself that Overwatch is a 
           team-oriented game, and your team needs to stick together. Your abilities are designed
            to excel when used in tandem with those of your allies, so grouping up makes you (and, 
            by extension, your team) far more effective. Even if you're playing a hero who is 
            incentivized to go rogue and flank the enemy - consider aggressors like Reaper and Tracer,
             or snipers Hanzo and Widowmaker - you should still aim to only engage when your opponents
              are actively distracted by your frontline.</p>
